# Fylo-Landing-Page
Objective: The objective of this project is to continue building single-page layouts and get better at css. In this project will go for a mobile first approach to see if that leads to less complexity when adding media queries. 

First thoughts: 
1. I Can see there is a from element with a required and placeholder attribute. 
2. The img element in the hero is above the text and form elements in the grid.
